# Pyng

## What is this?  
This is a Pong game I've made using *pygame*, in Python. It can be played on a local network (using *socket*) by changing `ADDR` and `PORT` in the files for both players. And to make pygame and socket work together (socket blocks the program to wait for data) I used *threading*.

## But how to play?  
1. Get Python
2. Change `ADDR` and `PORT`
3. Run server, then client
4. Realise you're not that good at Pong or the dev failed at making a simple game anyways jam to the background song
